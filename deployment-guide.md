# Email Service Fix for Netlify Deployment

I've identified and fixed the issues with your email service not working on Netlify. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## 1. Fixed API Endpoint Path

The main issue was that your frontend code was using `/api/send-email` in production, but Netlify functions are accessed via `/.netlify/functions/send-email`. I've updated the `emailService.ts` file to use the correct path.

## 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

I've improved the Netlify function with better error handling and logging to help diagnose any issues:
- Added logging for environment variable availability
- Created a function to initialize the transporter each time
- Added more detailed logging throughout the function
- Improved error response with stack trace in development mode

## 3. Environment Variables Setup

For the email service to work on Netlify, you need to set up the environment variables in your Netlify dashboard. See the `netlify-env-setup.md` file for detailed instructions.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the code changes to your repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix email service for Netlify deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables in Netlify**
   Follow the instructions in `netlify-env-setup.md` to add the Brevo SMTP credentials to your Netlify environment.

3. **Trigger a new deployment**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to your site
   - Click on "Deploys"
   - Click on "Trigger deploy" > "Deploy site"

4. **Verify the fix**
   - After deployment, try sending an invitation from your application
   - Check the Netlify function logs for any errors:
     - Go to your site's dashboard
     - Click on "Functions"
     - Click on the "send-email" function
     - Check the logs for any error messages

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues after deploying these changes:

1. **Check Netlify function logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are correctly set in the Netlify dashboard
3. **Test the function directly** by making a POST request to `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-email` with the appropriate JSON body
4. **Check browser console** for any frontend errors when sending emails

The enhanced logging in the function should help identify any remaining issues.
